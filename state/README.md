# State Pattern

The main situation that gives rise to the Design Pattern State is the need to implement a state machine. Generally, the
control of the possible transitions between states are several, they are also complex, making the implementation not
simple. The state helps keep track of states simple and organized by creating classes that represent each state and
knowing how to control the transitions between them.

### Potential drawbacks and limitations

Complexity: The State pattern can add complexity to the code, especially if there are a large number of states and
transitions between them. This can make the code harder to understand and maintain.

Coupling: The State pattern can create tight coupling between the context object and the state objects. This can make it
difficult to modify or extend the code without affecting other parts of the system.

Performance: The State pattern can add overhead to the system due to the additional objects and method calls required to
manage the state transitions.

Limited use cases: The State pattern is most useful when an object has a small number of well-defined states that change
frequently. In other situations, other patterns may be more appropriate.

Testing: Testing can become more complex with the State pattern, as it may be necessary to test each state object
individually as well as the context object and the transitions between states.

Inflexibility: The State pattern can be inflexible if the states and transitions between them are hard-coded into the
system. This can make it difficult to add new states or modify existing ones without making significant changes to the
code.
