repository to train design patterns using python
## what i think about design patterns
I don't believe we should use design patterns 100% of the time, design patterns are extremely useful and versatile,
something that helps us immensely, but in many cases, especially in simpler projects, we can solve problems that arise
using only the language itself. So we must analyze the projects that we want to create and think if any of the patterns
fits well in it so that we can implement them according to our needs.
